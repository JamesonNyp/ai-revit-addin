# Revit AI Assistant Mock UI Verification Report

## Summary
The mock UI implementation for the Revit AI Assistant is properly configured and ready for UX evaluation.

## Verified Components

### 1. Key Files Present ✓
- **AIAssistantPaneProvider.cs**: Correctly configured as dockable pane provider
- **MockAIAssistantViewModel.cs**: Comprehensive mock implementation with simulated AI responses
- **MockAIService.cs**: Mock service providing realistic AI responses and task execution
- **RevitAIAssistant.addin**: Properly configured manifest file

### 2. Build Configuration ✓
- Target Framework: .NET Framework 4.8 (correct for Revit 2025)
- Platform: x64
- Post-build events configured to copy files to Revit add-ins folder
- All necessary dependencies included

### 3. Missing Dependencies Resolved ✓
- Created `appsettings.json` configuration file
- Added icon resources (16x16 and 32x32 PNG files)
- Fixed XAML resource references and converters

### 4. UI Components ✓
- Chat interface with user/assistant/system message templates
- Quick action buttons for common engineering tasks
- Task execution progress tracking
- Rich content presentation for engineering plans and calculations
- Theme support (Dark/Light modes)

### 5. Mock Functionality ✓
The mock implementation provides:
- Simulated AI responses for engineering queries
- Mock task planning and execution
- Progress tracking with simulated delays
- PE approval simulation
- Calculation results display
- Context awareness (selected elements, active systems)

## Build Instructions

### Using PowerShell Script (Recommended)
```powershell
cd /home/jnyp/coding/CC-Testing/ai-revit-addin
./scripts/build.ps1 -Configuration Debug
```

### Manual Build (if .NET SDK available)
```bash
cd /home/jnyp/coding/CC-Testing/ai-revit-addin
dotnet restore
dotnet build src/RevitAIAssistant/RevitAIAssistant.csproj -c Debug -p:Platform=x64
```

### Manual Installation (if build tools not available)
1. The project requires MSBuild or .NET SDK to compile
2. If building on a different machine, copy the compiled output to:
   `%APPDATA%\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\2025\`

## Post-Build Deployment
The project is configured to automatically copy files to the Revit add-ins folder:
- DLL files: `RevitAIAssistant.dll` and dependencies
- Manifest: `RevitAIAssistant.addin`
- Configuration: `appsettings.json`

## Testing the Mock UI
1. Launch Revit 2025
2. Look for "AI Assistant" tab in the ribbon
3. Click "Start AI Assistant" to open the dockable pane
4. Test interactions:
   - Type queries in the input box
   - Use quick action buttons
   - Observe mock responses and task execution
   - Check theme switching functionality

## Notes
- The mock implementation does not require backend services
- All responses are simulated with realistic delays
- PE approval dialogs are mocked for UX evaluation
- The UI supports both dark and light themes
- Icons are embedded as resources in the assembly
